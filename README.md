# The Monty Hall Problem

#### https://monty-hall-app.herokuapp.com/
##### A Django Vue.js application. It is designed to have the users collectively do the Monty Hall Problem, so everyone can see the statistical inevitability that switching doors are to the player's advantage. 

##### If you are unaware of the Monty Hall Problem, here is the introduction of the app to it. 


## Introduction

##### Imagine that you are on a game show and asked to pick between three doors. One of the doors has a car behind it, and the other two have a goat. After you have chosen your first door, the host opens one of the other two doors revealing a goat. He then asks you, "Would you like to switch doors or open up your original one?"

##### Against intuitive logic, the correct answer is to switch doors. Yes, it does in fact make you more likely to win, even if it is hard to believe. If you chose your original door, your odds of winning are only 33%; the same as your original guess. If you switch doors, you have a 66% chance to win.

##### This concept is often hard to believe, and many people reject it. The mind tends to make the false assumption that the choices should be the same, when in fact they are not.

##### I created a program that lets you play the game and more importantly, see the results. Each time you get a goat or a car, the program saves if it was your original choice, or if you switched. Everyone's choices are being added up. Statistical truth will undoubtedly reveal itself that switching is to your advantage.
